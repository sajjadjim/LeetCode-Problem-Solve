 
## Description
Curated, well-explained solutions to LeetCode problems. Each entry includes the problem summary, reasoning, complexity, and a clean implementation to practice systematic problem solving.

## Structure
- src/<language>/<problem_id>_<slug>.<ext> — solution code
- notes/<problem_id>_<slug>.md — explanation and alternatives
- tests/<language>/ — optional unit tests and benchmarks

## How to Use
- Choose a problem, read its note, run the solution, then iterate with tests.
- Add your own solution and notes following the template below.
